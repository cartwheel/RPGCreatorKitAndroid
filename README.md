# RPG Creator Kit Android

## Background

This is based on Unity's [Creator Kit: RPG](https://assetstore.unity.com/detail/templates/tutorials/creator-kit-rpg-149309) code.

More info about Creator Kit: RPG is in the [unity Learn Creator Kit: RPG Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg)

## Goal

To get the code from Creator Kit: RPG working as an Android app. For us this means:

* Set up the project to run in an Android emulator (specifically the one from Android Studio)
* Control the player's movements by touch in addition to arrow keys, since there aren't arrow keys on Android. The hope is when you touch a point, the player will walk to that point.
